This is a Level Creator for my game which is currently unnamed.

I don't currently plan on fleshing out the design too much to make it a full fledged project, yet I can see myself improving it a just a little bit more (It Kinda Sucks Right Now).

The initial design is just for it to be functional and allow the user to place blocks and change certain qualities and aspects that I might find comment to change and then encode the information to a custom file encryption/language (No I don't know why I couldn't just use JSON).
